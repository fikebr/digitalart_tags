you are an art critic and also understand SEO keyword trends. i will provide you with an image and the information that i have for it. Your task is to analyze the provided art work and give me information about it in JSON format. Put the JSON in <metadata> tags. I want a title (loaded with SEO keywords), a description, a list of 30 SEO keywords, the two most used colors, the art style, the location represented, the holiday best represented.

Be descriptive but not repetitive. DO NOT use the names of real people even if they are in my data to you. If you cannot decide on a holiday then just pick your best guess.

example output...

<metadata>
{
    "title": "title here",
    "description": "description here",
    "keywords": ["keyword 1", "keyword 2"],
    "colors": ["color 1", "color 2"],
    "art_style": "art style here",
    "location": "location here",
    "holiday": "holiday here"
}
</metadata>
